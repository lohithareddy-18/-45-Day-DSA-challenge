45 Days DSA Challenge
Welcome to the 45 Days DSA Challenge! This challenge is designed to helped me to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in a structured and efficient manner over the course of 45 days. By the end of this challenge, you'll have a solid understanding of key DSA concepts, which are crucial for coding interviews and competitive programming.

Objective
The main objective of this challenge is to provide a disciplined approach to learning and practicing DSA. Each day is focused on a specific topic, with carefully curated problems to solve, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the subject.

Features
Daily Topics: Focus on one DSA topic each day, allowing deep dives into specific areas.
Curated Problems: A selection of problems for each topic, handpicked to reinforce learning and practice.
Progress Tracking: Keep track of your daily progress and completed problems.
Difficulty Levels: Problems range from easy to hard, catering to all skill levels.
Interview Preparation: Emphasis on problems commonly asked in technical interviews at top tech companies.
